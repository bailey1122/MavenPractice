 <question>Sample project doesn't work. Why does sample project suck?</question>
 <answer>
 <p>
 We resent that question. Sample wasn't designed to work, it was designed to
 show you how to use Maven. If you really think this project sucks, then
 keep it to yourself. We're not interested in your pestering questions.
